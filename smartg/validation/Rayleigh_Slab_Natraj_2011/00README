Here we tabulate Stokes parameter results for optical thickness unity and larger. We use 
the same definitions of Stokes parameters as given by Hovenier and van der Mee (1983) and 
Hovenier et al. (2004), to which we refer for a more extensive treatment. These Stokes 
parameters are essentially the same as those in Chandrasekhar (1950) and van de Hulst 
(1957, 1980). We refer the reader to Natraj and Hovenier (2011) for computational details 
and discussions of the tabulated results.

The results for I, Q and U are tabulated for the following sets of parameters:

TAU = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, 128, 256, 512, 1024, Infinity
ALBEDO = 0.0, 0.25, 0.8
MU0 = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, ..., 0.96, 0.98, 1.00
MU = 0.00, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, ..., 0.96, 0.98, 1.00
PHI = 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180

Here, TAU is the optical thickness; ALBEDO is the ground albedo of an underlying Lambert 
surface; MU0 is the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the incident beam and 
the vertical; MU is the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between the emergent beam 
and the vertical; PHI is the relative azimuth angle between the emergent and incident 
beams.

The files are named as follows:

{I/Q/U}_{UP/DN}_TAU_{1/2/4/8/16/32/64/100/128/256/512/1024}

and

{I/Q/U}_UP_TAU_INFINITY

where the filename has one of each argument inside the parentheses. UP, DN refer, 
respectively, to upwelling radiation emerging from the top of the atmosphere and 
downwelling radiation emerging from the bottom of the atmosphere. For infinite optical 
thickness, there are no downwelling results since they are all identically zero.
