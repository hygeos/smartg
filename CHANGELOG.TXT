v0.9.2
------

Release date: 2019-05-23

* Source code release !
  This release now includes the source code for the kernel instead of binaries.
  This allows for more flexilibity with respect to compilation options.

* New! 3D objects (in development)
    - 3D objects require smartg option Smartg(opt3D=True) and work in either forward or backward mode
    - Designed to simulate a solar tower power plant
    - Please check notebooks/demo_notebook_objects.ipynb
    - The following features are implemented:
        -> Reflectors (mirrors with optional roughness)
        -> Receivers with flux distribution map (direct, diffuse...)
        -> Custom photon launching options (target an area or specific objects:
           see option Smartg().run(cusL=...))
        -> Utilities to quickly generate a 3D scene with heliostats and a tower
           (see smartg/visualizegeo.py)

* New! Refraction and limb geometry
    - Please check notebooks/demo_notebook.ipynb

* ALIS method is now validated and extended to water
    - Please check notebooks/Validation_smartg_compilation.ipynb
      which compiles all validation exercises for Smart-G and an example of
      perturbative Jacobians

* Locale estimate: add 'zip' option to allow for non-cartesian product of
  output angles

* Notebooks have been extended

* New! 3D atmosphere (in development - undocumented)
