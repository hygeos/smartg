  - more options
  - not only remove useless outputs but avoid also useless photon counting

* New key for local estimate intput dictionary
  - the key 'count_level' to choose if we want to count only a particular level (in plan parallel), 
    see the doctring of the smartg run method

* The smartg 3D atm mode is now validated, but still in dev!!
  - A huge change (modules, classes, ...) is planned for this mode, so it is not recommended to use it for now.

  - The notebook validation_SMARTG_IPRT_phaseB-C2.ipynb is available with examples but will be 
    obselete in future release!

  - ...

------
Release date: 2024-08-29

* Correction of a bug in function calc_iphase.

* Correction of a bug that occurs with high values of water vapor (H2O)


v1.0.1
------

* Missing auxiliary data in Makefile added (Clouds and IPRT).

* The previous CHANGELOG corrected.


v1.0.0
------
Release date: 2024-05-17

* Downloading libRadtran is not needed anymore. Auxiliary data has been completely
  rebuilt and can be downloaded using the Makefile.

* New way to compute the OPAC aerosol models (use AerOPAC instead of AeroOPAC).
    - Important correction concerning the mixing of species!
    - The OPAC mixtures are pre-calculated with MOPSMAP (https://mopsmap.net/).
    - The OPAC models vertical distribution can be ajusted (composed of aerosols
      from mixture and/or free troposphere and/or stratophere).
    - OPAC models updated! see [Koepke et al. 2015]. The new desert and antartic models
      with spheroid particles are considered. The old spherical versions are also
      available, see -> 'desert_spheric' and 'antartic_spheric'. 

* New cloud models (use Cloud instead of CloudOPAC), taken from ARTDECO
    - small correction on the phase matrix computation
    - water cloud can have now an effective radius up 30 um (instead of 14 previouly).
    - Ice clouds are considered! 3 available: baum_ghm, baum_asc and baum_sc

* New way to consider the gaseous density vertical distribution (still with AFGL)

* New way to consider the gaseous absorption cross section (NO2 and O3)
