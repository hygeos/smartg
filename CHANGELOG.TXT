           ###########################


v1.0.7
------
Release data: 2025-06-03

* Correct the env file by removing default conda channel

* Update the README

* Correct several bugs occuring when a user incorporate its own mixture file
  - For mixture with wl axis dimension different to the provided mixture wl dimension
  - For mixture with a humidity axis size equal to 1

* Complete the python doc of AerOPAC
  - Missing Z_mix, Z_free and Z_stra definitions


v1.0.6
------
Release data: 2025-05-25

* Avoid bug due to scipy function renaming since version 1.14
  - Force scipy version<1.14 while installing python dependencies


v1.0.5
------
Release date: 2024-12-03

* Correction of a bug in transform matrix inversion when 2 transform objects
  are multiplied (Python part not CUDA)

* Cleaning and some corrections
  - hygeos url link corrected
  - some cleaning in transform.py
  - add SMART-G logo and DOI in README

* Rewriting AerOPAC and Cloud python documentation


v1.0.4
------
Release date: 2024-09-11

* Correction of a crash occuring while using the new calc_iphase function
  (introduced in v1.0.3) inside ocean.


v1.0.3
------
Release date: 2024-08-29

* Correction of a bug in function calc_iphase.
  - The bug may appear while giving a pfgrid array with a size > 3,
    and with pfgrid != grid (z_atm)


v1.0.2
------
Release date: 2024-08-22

* Correction of a bug that occurs with high values of water vapor (H2O)


v1.0.1
------
Release date: 2024-06-20

* Missing auxiliary data in Makefile added (Clouds and IPRT).

* The previous CHANGELOG corrected.


v1.0.0
------
Release date: 2024-05-17

* Downloading libRadtran is not needed anymore. Auxiliary data has been completely
  rebuilt and can be downloaded using the Makefile.

* New way to compute the OPAC aerosol models (use AerOPAC instead of AeroOPAC).
    - Important correction concerning the mixing of species!
    - The OPAC mixtures are pre-calculated with MOPSMAP (https://mopsmap.net/).
    - The OPAC models vertical distribution can be ajusted (composed of aerosols
      from mixture and/or free troposphere and/or stratophere).
    - OPAC models updated! see [Koepke et al. 2015]. The new desert and antartic models
      with spheroid particles are considered. The old spherical versions are also
      available, see -> 'desert_spheric' and 'antartic_spheric'. 

* New cloud models (use Cloud instead of CloudOPAC), taken from ARTDECO
    - small correction on the phase matrix computation
    - water cloud can have now an effective radius up 30 um (instead of 14 previouly).
    - Ice clouds are considered! 3 available: baum_ghm, baum_asc and baum_sc

* New way to consider the gaseous density vertical distribution (still with AFGL)

* New way to consider the gaseous absorption cross section (NO2 and O3)
    - Add new O3 Bogumil data (Chehade et al. 2013)
    - Add O3 acs from Serdyuchenko et al. 2014
    - Add NO2 data from Bingen et al. 2019

* K-distribution now available !
    - 3 kdis -> kato, kato2 and SENTINEL_2_1_MSI
    - The kdis format (ascii or h5) is now automatically recognized

* In general: The repository has been cleaned. And several fixes and improvements
  have been made.


v0.9.4
------
Release date: 2024-02-27

* Bug corrections
    - bug in generatePro_multi visible when using pfwav corrected
    - bug when using pfgrid in the calculation of the phase matrix corrected


v0.9.3
------

Release date: 2024-02-19

* General Updates (codes and notebooks) to work with last python packages, and corrections

* 3D objects improvements
    - 3D objects can be used in LE (Local Estimate) mode
    - Cuboid objects can be created using the function generateBox where each face have
     its own albedo (see visualizegeo module)
    - A 3D object face albedo can now vary spectrally

* Validation with all IPRT phase A test cases
  - The complete notebook with all test cases is available
  - Some tests can be tested with pytest -> use pytest tests/test_quick_iprt_phaseA.py

* Spheriod aerosols (see IPRT phase A notebook case A4) and ice clouds are now considered
  if the phase matrix is given manually.

* Several improvements in 3D atmosphere mode. But still in development and not documented


v0.9.2
------

Release date: 2019-05-23

* Source code release !
  This release now includes the source code for the kernel instead of binaries.
  This allows for more flexilibity with respect to compilation options.

* New! 3D objects (in development)
    - 3D objects require smartg option Smartg(opt3D=True) and work in either forward or backward mode
    - Designed to simulate a solar tower power plant
    - Please check notebooks/demo_notebook_objects.ipynb
    - The following features are implemented:
        -> Reflectors (mirrors with optional roughness)
        -> Receivers with flux distribution map (direct, diffuse...)
        -> Custom photon launching options (target an area or specific objects:
           see option Smartg().run(cusL=...))
        -> Utilities to quickly generate a 3D scene with heliostats and a tower
           (see smartg/visualizegeo.py)

* New! Refraction and limb geometry
    - Please check notebooks/demo_notebook.ipynb

* ALIS method is now validated and extended to water
    - Please check notebooks/Validation_smartg_compilation.ipynb
      which compiles all validation exercises for Smart-G and an example of
      perturbative Jacobians

* Locale estimate: add 'zip' option to allow for non-cartesian product of
  output angles

* Notebooks have been extended

* New! 3D atmosphere (in development - undocumented)


v0.9.1
------

Release date: 2018-11-01

* Add compilation support for additional architectures, including GeForce 20xx
  series (Turing).
* Fix OPAC phase function interpolation
* Add aerosol altitude scaling options


v0.9
----

Release date: 2018-09-21

First public release.
